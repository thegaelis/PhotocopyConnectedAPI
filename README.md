#PHOTOCOPY CONNECTED PROJECT - API

A website that connects the photocopy service store together. It helps customer to choose a photocopy store and send documents to selected store to print.

This will help customer saving lots of time in printing document. Customer no need to wait at the photocopy store. Just send the document, go to the store to grab and done.

For convenience, online payment will be implemented. First release will use vnpay (sandbox) to make payment.

For technical information, this is the API of the PhotocopyConnected.

This is one of my pet projects :D
